PROBLEM STATEMENT:
810 women die everyday as a result of the complexities of childbirth. According to WHO, the main factors that prevent women from receiving or seeking care during pregnancy and childbirth are:
Poverty

Most of the complications develop during pregnancy are preventable or treatable if healthcare provider get time to time information of women and newbie. Physical distance between pregnant women and healthcare providers too should not restrain the quality of treatment they get.
