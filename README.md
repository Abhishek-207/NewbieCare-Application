PROBLEM STATEMENT:
810 women die everyday as a result of the complexities of childbirth. According to WHO, the main factors that prevent women from receiving or seeking care during pregnancy and childbirth are:
Poverty
Distance to facilities
Lack of information
Inadequate and poor quality services

We here are stressing on reducing multiple visits of MOTHER'S TO BE to doctors,  distance to facilities and lack of information. Most of the complications develop during pregnancy are preventable or treatable if healthcare provider get time to time information of women and newbie. Physical distance between pregnant women and healthcare providers too should not restrain the quality of treatment they get.
 
 
 PROPOSED SOLUTION: We have developed a "Newbie Handband" and an Application that assesses the use of sensors and the internet of things IOT as an innovative technology to monitor maternal health during pregnancy.
